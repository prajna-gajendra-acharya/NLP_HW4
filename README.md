This repository contains my full implementation for :

- **Part 1:** Fine-tuning **BERT** for *sentiment classification* on IMDB  
- **Part 2:** Fine-tuning **T5-small** for *Text-to-SQL* mapping on the ATIS-style flight database

Both parts include training code, evaluation scripts, model outputs, and analysis.

# Environment Setup

It is recommended to use Python **3.10+**.
